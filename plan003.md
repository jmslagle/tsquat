# Plan 003: Integration & Enhancement Roadmap

## Overview
Plan 003 outlines the integration of Phase 1 and Phase 2 components, plus potential future enhancements for the TSquat penetration testing tool.

## Current Integration Status: âœ… COMPLETED

### Unified CLI Interface
The main `tsquat.py` script successfully integrates both phases:

```bash
# Phase 1 only: Domain generation and registration
python tsquat.py example.com --register

# Phase 2 only: Website cloning
python tsquat.py example.com --clone

# Combined workflow: Full typosquatting simulation
python tsquat.py example.com --register --clone --max-variants 50
```
